The DLBA is seeking proposals to support the activation and stewardship of vacant land sites, including urban agriculture, gardening, or beautification, whether for profit or community activation. Interested buyers should consult our proposal guidelines for land-based sites and our Guide to Plot Plan, Site Design, and Maintenance. The DLBA also recommends reviewing relevant Neighborhood Framework Plans from the City of Detroitâ€™s Planning and Development Department for additional context about the neighborhood. Please note that the DLBA is entitled to a tax capture for the 5 tax years subsequent to transferring ownership of the property. The tax capture may be incompatible with tax abatement that are otherwise available to the selected purchaser. DLBA will review requests to waive its tax capture rights and may require a payment in lieu of taxes to approve such requests. The payment will be determined upon reviewing the development proforma and effect of any tax abatement on the purchase and development

What exactly does this opportunity present, you may ask? It offers the opportunity to homestead, a beautiful area for a plentiful garden to grow your own food, a large pole barn reattached garage to work on your equipment and store it away, and a large barn that offers plenty of opportunities to house your livestock in comfort. To add it is located on a low traffic blacktop road within 2 miles of Ohio 7 S. And what comes to mind when we begin to talk about the house? Well, the word is nostalgia. This place may need a little elbow grease, but I've been around this county my whole life, and I've seen a lot of these farmhouse-style homes, and they just provide primitive charm that can't be duplicated. This place is in great shape for a rehab to make it into that big dream home. While the way it sits, it's more than livable, offering tons of charm, main-level living, a main-level office, and two additional upstairs bedrooms. Plus, the house features main level laundry and one full bathroom, adding to its convenience. If you are looking for a weekend getaway, this one could stand true to being that base camp hunting lodge or that weekend getaway as well. It's just beautiful out here at 763 Swan Creek. Additionally, the property spans approximately 6 acres +/-. All information considered reliable, but not GUARANTEED. Maps are of approximate boundaries subject to survey.

Country living at its finest! You cant beat the setting for this two-story home accompanied with two barns and 60 acres to enjoy all to yourself. Dont miss out on this opportunity to walk out your front door and enjoy everything nature has to offer. A perfect place to enjoy your morning coffee and listen to the world come alive. Surrounding the house is approx. 3.5 acres of fenced in pasture, perfect for livestock or gardening. The road frontage on this property equals out to be roughly 1400, with frontage on both sides of the road. The two acres of open/flat across from the house could be sold off separately for income. The two-story home with utilities on site includes 3 BR and 1 bath, with a poured concrete porch and and 27 x 36 metal building. Plenty of space for vehicles and other equipment such as tractors or atvs. Swan creek, which flows year-round, runs directly through the property. Swan creek road itself is very private, with little through traffic. Believe it or not everything weve already covered only makes up less than half the property! There is still 40+/- acres that we havent touched on. This section is mainly timber and is made up of rolling to steep terrain. This gives you access to excellent hunting, hiking, or trail riding the minute you step out your front door. As I made my way through the trail system, the abundant wildlife sign made it clear this place would be a no-brainer for anyone looking to manage their own property. The terrain changes and heavy foliage makes this a perfect sanctuary for big southern Ohio bucks to hideout in. There is a good variety of timber species, including white and red oak, hickory, poplar, and others native to Ohio. This property is situated less than 2 miles from the Ohio River and West Virginia border and would make a great deer camp for someone out of state. If WV and Ohio arent enough, Eastern Kentucky is also just a short trip, roughly 30 miles, allowing you opportunities to hunt in three different states all within an hour of your home.
